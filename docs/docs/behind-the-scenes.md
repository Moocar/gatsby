Curious how Gatsby works under the hood? This pages in this section describe how a Gatsby build works from an internal code/architecture point of view. It should be useful for anyone who needs to work on the internals of Gatsby, or for those who are simply curious how it all works.

If you're looking for information on how to _use_ Gatsby to write your own site, or create a plugin, check out the rest of the Gatsby docs.

These docs aren't supposed to be definitive, or tell you everything there is to know. But as you're exploring the Gatsby codebase, you might find yourself wondering what a concept means, or which part of the codebase implements a particular idea. These docs aim to answer those kinds of questions.
